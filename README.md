# Malagasy Introduction
> Note: There are about 18 ethnic groups and hence many dialetcs. The language of the coast dwellers may differ heavily from the Merina people in the capital.

After traveling around Madagascar and spending some time on Nosy Be, I managed to understand the following words and phrases.
